Custom Ajax Functions
---------------------

Custom Ajax Functions have been precoded in this theme. For example, to load "Settings" tab you should call the function    
	loadContent('settings');      

Similarily, you can call      
      
loadContent('profile');     
loadContent('projects');    
loadContent('dashboard');    


The Unique Mini Tasks Module
----------------------------

A precoded Extremely useful Mini Tasks Module is supplied with this theme.
A global 'tasks' object controls this module.   

It contains functions like   
tasks.add(taskId, task);    
tasks.updateState(taskId, newTaskState);    
tasks.changeTask(taskId, newTask);    
tasks.remove(taskId);   

Use this module to add tasks.

### WrapBootstrap's policy is supplying updates for free, if you have purchased the theme. :)
